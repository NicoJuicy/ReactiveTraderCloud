# Reactive Trader速 (ARCHIVED)

THIS REPO WILL NOT BE UPDATED IN FUTURE.

However, it remains as a public example of a reactive UI of significant scale using React, Rxjs, and react-rxjs, with desktop variants for OpenFin and Finsemble, connecting to an Adaptive Hydra速 / Aeron速 backend.
The showcase linked below will remain current, but the desktop variants will not be part of the suite in future.

## Description

Reactive Trader速 is a real-time FX trading platform designed to showcase reactive programming principles across the full application stack.

Written in React and RxJs / React-RxJs and running on [Hydra](https://weareadaptive.com/hydra/), the platform will continue to evolve and use the latest technologies.

Please see [our Showcase page](https://weareadaptive.com/showcase/) for a full list of the latest features.
